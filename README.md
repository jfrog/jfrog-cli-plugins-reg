# JFrog CLI plugins registry
## General
**JFrog CLI Plugins** allow enhancing the functionality of [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI) to meet the specific user and organization needs. The source code of a plugin is maintained as an open source Go project on GitHub. All public plugins are registered in **JFrog CLI's Plugins Registry**. The Registry is hosted in this GitHub repository. The [plugins](plugins) directory includes a descriptor file for each plugin included in the Registry. 

## Installing a plugin 
After a plugin is included in this Registry, it becomes available for installation using JFrog CLI. JFrog CLI version 1.41.1 or above is required. To install a plugin included in this registry, run the following JFrog CLI command - Â `jfrog plugin install plugin-name`.
